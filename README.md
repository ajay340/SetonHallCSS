In addition, you want all of your information to registration ready.

    by going to the registration link and looking at options, beforehand.

2.) Course Scheduling Time (Like 2018-08-12 15:00) - Make sure you know your exact time for course
    scheduling. The time format is year-month-day hours:minutes. The hours is in the 24 hour format,

To get started double click on the SHCSS.exe, a command prompt will come up first
then the GUI. Do not close either of them.

Now enter in the information in the GUI and click submit. Google Chrome will open up and automatically login to Piratenet and enter your pin. Once the time has arrived for your inputted course registration time, the program will submit your pin, enter all of your course numbers, and submit the registration. Hopefully you will be sucessfully registered for all of your classes.

If you receive any errors look at the command prompt as it will tell you what may have been causing them.
