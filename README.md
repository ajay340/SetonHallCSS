## Video Demo

In this video example, my course schedule timing was at 10/28 at 9:34pm for the Fall semester. So I entered in all of my information for Piratenet, my pin, the semester I'm registering for, and in this examples all of my course numbers are "x."
After clicking submit, Google Chrome opens up, enters my Piratenet login, and enters my pin. It waits until 9:34pm to submit my pin and enter all of my classes.

## Note
You will receive a zip file for the program. You need to extract the zip file and make sure these files are in the same folder: chromdriver.exe and another folder called lib which should contain the chromedriver.

Also, make sure you have [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) installed.

## Information you need before registering
In addition, you want all of your information to registration ready.


1.) Registration Semester (Like Fall 2019) - You will be able to find out which semesters are available
    by going to the registration link and looking at options, beforehand.

2.) Course Scheduling Time (Like 2018-08-12 15:00) - Make sure you know your exact time for course
    scheduling. The time format is year-month-day hours:minutes. The hours is in the 24 hour format,
    so 5:00pm is equivalent to 17:00. The timing is based off of your computer's system time. [Reference](http://militarytimechart.com/)

3.) Piratenet Login Credentials - Know your username and password. 2-factor authentication is not supported.

4.) Course Pin Number - Make sure you know your PIN number or contact your advisor to find out.

5.) Course Numbers: Make sure you know the CRNs of all of your classes you want to register for.

## Instructions
To get started double click on the SHCSS.exe, a command prompt will come up first
then the GUI. Do not close either of them.

Now enter in the information in the GUI and click submit. Google Chrome will open up and automatically login to Piratenet and enter your pin. Once the time has arrived for your inputted course registration time, the program will submit your pin, enter all of your course numbers, and submit the registration. Hopefully you will be sucessfully registered for all of your classes.

If you receive any errors look at the command prompt as it will tell you what may have been causing them.
